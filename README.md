# Hands on Labs

### [Configuration Management: Infrastructure Lab](./Labs/Configuration%20Management)
Deploy Azure resources using an ARM template. Includes the the following:
* Deploy VM1 - config using DSC  + Web Deploy
* Deploy VM2- config using Chef + Web Deploy
* Deploy VM3 - config using Puppet + Web Deploy

### [Desired State Configuration using Chef Server Lab](./Labs/DSC%20Using%20Chef%20Server)
During this lab, you will continue working with the 3 Azure Virtual Machines you deployed in the Azure Resource Manager lab. The goal of this lab is configuring a trial hosted Chef Server account, and using this technology to bootstrap any of the already deployed Windows Server Virtual Machines as web server running Internet Information Server

### [Automated Testing + Continuous Integration Lab](./Labs/Continous%20Integration)
Setup an automated build in VSTS.
Setup automated test cases using VSTS

### [Continuous Deployment Lab](./Labs/Continuous%20Deployment)
Implement a continuous deployment release pipeline by using visual studio team service

### [Modern Application Monitoring Lab](./Labs/Monitoring)
Configure monitoring for IaaS/PaaS workloads with ARM

### [Open Source on Microsoft Azure Lab](./Labs/Open%20Source/)
Implement CI and CD using open source technologies such as Docker and Jenkins
